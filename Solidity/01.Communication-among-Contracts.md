# Communication among contracts #
First of all, you need source codes of every contract that you want them to be able .... .
In this case, ```contract Jonah``` intend to call a function of ```contract Nicholas```, then you should have ...
```js
contract Jonah {
  ...
}
contract Nicholas {
  ...
}
```
Note that there's no need to inherit from the other.
