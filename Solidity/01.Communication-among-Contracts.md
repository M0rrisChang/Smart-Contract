# Communication among contracts #
In this tutorial, I suppose a new contract which is not mined yet intend to call another contract that was already mined.
## Source codes of contarcts ##
First of all, you need source codes of every contract that you want them to be able .... .
In this case, ```contract Game``` intend to call a function of ```contract Information```, then you should have ...
```js
contract Game {
  ...
}
contract Information {
  ...
}
```
Note that there's no need to inherit from the other.

## Address of the contract you intend to call ##
Let's say ```contract Game``` would need to get data from ```contract Information```, then ```contract Game``` must contain the address of mined ```contract Information```.
```js
contract Game {
  function result() {
    address infoAddress = 0xb2351eccb1cbb8045ff70cde881c1ee0645ce240; // address of mined contract Information
    Information information = Information(infoAddress);
    ...
  }
}
contract Information {
  ...
}
```
By doing so, function result of ```contract Game``` would be able to call mined ```contract Information```.
