# Solidity Tutorial #
Basic introduction of Solidity.

Reference: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Components of a contract ##
1. Contract name
2. Local variables
3. Functions

```solidity
contract Future {                      /* Defining a contract, just like "class Foo{}"         */
  address master;                      /* Local variable                                       */
  function Future(){                   /* Constructor, same name as contract, executed once    */
    ...                                /* when the contract is created                         */
  }                                    
  function bet() {                     /* Function                                             */
    ...
  }
}
```


## Object-oriented ##
### Inheritance ###
```solidity
contract safe {
  ...
}
contract Future is safe {
  ...
}
```
Future inherits all behaviors of safe (functions and local variables).
## Types ##
These are commonly used data types in smart contracts.
### address ###
```solidity
address owner = msg.sender;
```
owner's value would be the address of msg.sender.
Note that ```msg.sender``` is the user calling the contract.
### mappings ###
It's just like a map.
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;
balanceOf[msg.sender] = 0;
```
Using "=>" to determine types of key and value. In this map, ```address``` and ```uint``` would be types of the key and value.
### int / uint ###
```int``` and ```uint``` are aliases for ```int256``` and ```uint256```  (256 bits integer)
### array ###
```solidity
uint[] memory a = new uint[](7);         
```
Using keyword "memory" and "new" to declare an array. To master array operations, you should be [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html?highlight=Arrays#arrays).
### string ###
Not a value type! Not allowed to access by index.
### bytes ###
To be made clear..
### bool ###
Just true or false.

### struct ###
```solidity
struct gamble_data{
  uint value;
  uint guess;
}
```
And then using mapping to construct a map of the structure.
```solidity
mapping(address => gamble_data) public gamble;
```
## Something you should know ##
### msg.sender / msg.value ###
```msg.sender``` is the user sending a message. For examples, creating a contract or calling a function of a contract would both "send a message".

```msg.value``` is the value coming with the message.

## Example contract ##
Here's an example contract using features mentioned above.
```
contract safe{                  
    function(){             
        throw;
    }
}

contract Future is safe {
    address master;
    uint public pool;
    uint final_answer;

    struct gamble_data{
      uint value;
      uint guess;
    }

    mapping(address => gamble_data) public gamble;
    mapping(uint => uint) public guesspool;   /* key is the number you guess, value is the bet you make */
    bool public open;

    function Future(){
      master = msg.sender;
      open = true;
    }

    function update(){
      if(pool < this.balance)
      pool = this.balance;
    }

    function answer(uint answer){
      if(msg.sender != master)
          throw;
      final_answer = answer;
      open = false;
    }

    function bet(uint guess){
      if(!open || gamble[msg.sender].value > 0)
        throw;
      gamble[msg.sender] = gamble_data(msg.value, guess);
      guesspool[guess] += msg.value;
    }

    function getPrize()
    {
      if(open == false){
          if(gamble[msg.sender].guess == final_answer){
              //if the better's guess is correct
              msg.sender.send(pool * gamble[msg.sender].value / guesspool[final_answer]);
          }
      }
    }
}
```
